# Implementing Spatial Interactions with Third-Party Accessories

Establish a connection with a nearby accessory to receive periodic measurements of its distance from the user.



## Overview

- Note: This sample code project is associated with WWDC21 session [10165: Explore Nearby Interaction with Third-Party Accessories](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/10165).

- Note: The sample project from WWDC21 has been modified by Truesense to implement hands-free user experience through iOS 16 Nearby Interaction sessions with the app in background mode, as described in https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10008/ . 
  
## Configure the Sample Code Project

Set the run destination to an iPhone that contains a U1 chip. The sample app interacts with an accessory you partner with or develop using the [Ultra Wideband (UWB) third-party device specification](https://developer.apple.com/nearby-interaction).
